## Who would want to use this?

> This project aims to get you up and running with C++17 based project with a 'git clone' operation. As well, this particular C++ project template comes with builtin [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) support. This means that you can incorporate other [github](https://github.com) projects, (or anything that uses the git tool) into your project with the simple inclusion of a CPM directive in in your CMakeLists.txt file, (for C++11 support change the `--std=c++17` directive specified in CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS)

## Setup instructions
Assuming you have a Linux box setup you can create a project as follows:
> 1. [Generate your project using this template](https://github.com/perriera/extras_cpp/generate)<br/>
> **NOTE**: 
> When you create your project the 'extras_cpp' specified <br/>below will be replaced with your project name.<br/>
> 2. Clone the project to local directory using either the https or ssh url<br/>
> `git clone git@github.com:perriera/extras_cpp.git`
> 3. cd into the project and run the start up script<br/>
> `cd extras_cpp`<br/>
> `./RUNMEFIRST.sh`<br/>
> **OPTIONAL** <br/>
> When you specify a name for your project you may specify a sub name which will be converted into a namespace, (aka ***my_project*** instead of ***myproject*** ). In the case of sub name is **not** specified you will see a namespace called 'reassign' after the RUNMEFIRST.sh script is completed.

In the case where you don't have a Linux box already setup:

> 2. [How to install the tools necessary for C++11/17 projects](https://github.com/perriera/extras_cpp/blob/dev/docs/INSTALL.md)
 >3. [How to clone your project (with this template)](https://github.com/perriera/extras_cpp/blob/dev/docs/CLONE.md)
> 4. [How to setup your changelog.md](https://github.com/perriera/extras_cpp/blob/dev/docs/CHANGELOG.md)
